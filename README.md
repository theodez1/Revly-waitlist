<h1>Revly — Landing d’attente</h1>

![Revly](/src/app/opengraph-image.png)

<p>
  Revly est une application pensée pour les passionnés d’auto, moto et 4x4 : enregistrez vos sorties, analysez vos stats et partagez des spots et itinéraires d’exception.
  Cette landing est construite avec Next.js 15, Notion (inscriptions), Upstash (rate limit) et Resend (emails).
 </p>

## Fonctionnalités

- **Next.js 15**: Built with the latest features of the leading React framework for performance and developer experience.
- **Notion as CMS**: Seamlessly manage your waitlist entries directly within a Notion database.
- **Upstash Redis**: Implement robust rate limiting for signups using serverless Redis.
- **Resend Integration**: Send transactional emails (e.g., confirmation emails) through Resend using your custom domain.
- **One-Click Vercel Deploy**: Get your waitlist live in minutes.
- **Tailwind CSS & React**: Modern, responsive UI built with utility-first CSS and React components.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for a more robust codebase.

## Pourquoi Notion comme CMS ?

Notion is a versatile tool renowned for its content management capabilities and user-friendly interface. This template demonstrates how to leverage Notion as a lightweight, free, and effective Content Management System (CMS) for your waitlist.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Simplicity**: Manage your waitlist data in a familiar Notion database.
- **No Backend Needed**: Fetches data directly via Notion's API, reducing complexity.
- **Flexibility**: Easily extendable to manage other types of content beyond a waitlist.
- **Collaboration**: Utilize Notion's collaborative features if working with a team.

## Prérequis: Services externes

Before you can run this project, you'll need to configure a few external services:

### 1. Upstash Redis

Upstash provides serverless Redis. This template uses it for rate limiting signups.
1.  Sign up for a free account at [Upstash](https://upstash.com/).
2.  Create a new Redis database.
3.  From the database details page, note down the `REST API -> Endpoint` (this is your `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`) and `REST API -> Read-only Token` or a custom token with write access (this is your `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`). Ensure the token has write permissions if you're using it for operations that modify data.

### 2. Resend

Resend is used for sending transactional emails (e.g., signup confirmations).
1.  Create an account at [Resend](https://resend.com/).
2.  Add and verify your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
3.  Generate an API key from the "API Keys" section. This will be your `RESEND_API_KEY`.
4.  Note the email address you'll send from (e.g., `waitlist@yourdomain.com`). This will be your `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`.

### 3. Notion

Your waitlist data will be stored in a Notion database.
1.  Ensure you have a Notion account and workspace.
2.  Create a new **Database - Full page** in your workspace. You can name it "Waitlist Users" or similar.
3.  Add the following properties (columns) to your database:
    -   `Name` (Property type: `Title`) - This is usually the default first column.
    -   `Email` (Property type: `Email`)
    -   *(Optional)* `Signed Up At` (Property type: `Created time`) - For tracking when users signed up.
4.  Obtain your Notion Integration Secret:
    -   Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
    -   Click "+ New integration".
    -   Give it a name (e.g., "Waitlist App Integration").
    -   Associate it with your workspace.
    -   Under "Capabilities", ensure "Insert content" is checked. If you plan to read or update entries via an API later (e.g., for an admin panel), also grant "Read content" and "Update content" capabilities. "No user information" is fine for "User capabilities".
    -   Click "Submit". Copy the "Internal Integration Token" shown. This is your `NOTION_SECRET`.
5.  Share the Database with your Integration:
    -   Open the Notion database you created.
    -   Click the `•••` (More) menu in the top-right corner.
    -   Scroll down and click "+ Add connections" (or find "Connections" then "Connect to...").
    -   Search for and select the integration you just created (e.g., "Waitlist App Integration"). Confirm access.
6.  Get your Database ID:
    -   Open the Notion database in your browser. The URL will look something like:
        `https://www.notion.so/{YOUR_WORKSPACE_NAME}/{DATABASE_ID}?v={...}`
    -   The `{DATABASE_ID}` is the string of characters (usually 32 alphanumeric characters) that forms the path segment after your workspace name (or `www.notion.so/`) and before the `?v=...`. Copy this ID. This is your `NOTION_DB`.

## Développement en local

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  **Cloner le dépôt :**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/revly-landing.git
    cd revly-landing
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager in the example commands. You can use `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` if you prefer, by adjusting the commands accordingly.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project. You can copy `.env.example` and fill in the values you obtained from the prerequisite steps:
    ```env
    # Upstash Redis
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_rest_url
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_rest_token

    # Notion
    NOTION_SECRET=your_notion_secret_key
    NOTION_DB=your_notion_database_id

    # Resend
    RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
    RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=you@yourdomain.com # Email address to send from (must be verified in Resend)
    # RESEND_REPLY_TO_EMAIL=reply@yourdomain.com # Optional: Email address for replies
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Run the Email Preview Server (Optional):**
    If you're working on email templates, Resend allows local previewing of emails.
    ```bash
    pnpm email
    ```
    This typically starts a server on `http://localhost:3001` (or as configured in `package.json`).
